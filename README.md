## About
VergilPlus is a software that makes course planning effortless for students. Whereas currently students have to browse through an entire catalog that contains mostly irrelevant or unavailable courses, VergilPlus lets students bypass the frustration of picking out the courses right for them. Our course recommendation system is based on [sentimental analysis](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/sentiment-tutorial) of [previous students' reviews](http://culpa.info/), so it will find the best courses that suit you the most.  In particular, given a set of courses that a student has already taken, a professor that the student would like to work with or a topic that student is interest in, VergilPlus uses [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) to understand the user's needs and outputs the courses that fit these constraints.  

This repository is an improved version of my [team project](https://github.com/pow25/vergilplus).  It showcases much more elegant and efficient code, along with newly incorporated tools such as MyBatis.  

## Tools and Frameworks
